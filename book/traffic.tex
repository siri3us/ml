\chapter{Классификация трафика}
The suite of classifiers includes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the payload-based classifier, crl pay, which has been developed and widely
	used by the Internet research community
	\item the graph-based classifiers, BLINC and Traffic Dispersion Graphs
	\item the CoralReef’s [1] ports-applications matching database (i.e., ports-based classifier)
	\item the seven most commonly used machine learning algorithms such as C4.5 Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Kernel Estimation,
	Bayesian Networks, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines
	\item a combined weight-based classifier which takes classification results from some or all of the aforementioned classifiers and performs a
	weighted voting process to derive a single best classification result.
\end{itemize}

Метрики:
\begin{itemize}
	\item per-trace accuracy (Overall Accuracy)
	\item per-application accuracy (Precision, Recall, and FMeasure)
	\item computational performance (Learning Time
	and Classification Time)
\end{itemize}

Проблемы:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Классификатор привязан к точке своего функционирования
\end{itemize}

Вопросы
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is the whole dataset is unlabeled at the beginning? So, to train the classifier we first of all apply DPI to the training dataset to make it labeled?
	\item Only ``elephant'' flows are considered? What are these flows?
\end{itemize}
